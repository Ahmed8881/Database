# Database Project

## Overview

The **Database Project** is a lightweight, command-line-based database engine implemented in **C**. Inspired by SQLite, it offers fundamental functionalities for managing and querying data using a B-Tree data structure. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the core principles behind database systems, including data storage, indexing, and query processing.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Database Support:** Create and manage multiple databases
- **Table Management:** Create tables with various data types
- **Insert Records:** Add new entries to the database
- **Select Records:** Retrieve and display stored data
- **Select Records by ID:** Retrieve and display a specific record by its ID
- **Update Records:** Modify existing entries in the database
- **Delete Records:** Remove entries from the database
- **B-Tree Indexing:** Efficient data organization and retrieval using B-Trees
- **Command-Line Interface:** Interactive shell for executing SQL-like commands
- **Meta-Commands:** Special commands prefixed with `.` for additional functionalities like viewing the B-Tree structure and application constants

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Make
- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmed8881/Database.git
   cd Database
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   Use the provided `Makefile` to compile the source code.

   ```sh
   make
   ```

   - This command compiles the C source files and generates the executable at `bin/db-project`.

   For a debug build with additional debug symbols and flags:

   ```sh
   make DEBUG=1
   ```

   - This compiles the code with debug flags (`-DDEBUG`, `-O0`) for easier troubleshooting.
3. **Clean Build Artifacts (Optional):**

   To remove compiled objects and binaries, run:

   ```sh
   make clean
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   Execute the compiled binary:

   ```sh
   ./bin/db-project
   ```

---

## Usage

Upon running the application, you'll enter an interactive shell where you can execute SQL-like commands and meta-commands.

### Database Management Commands

- **Create a Database:**

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE database_name
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE school
  ```

- **Use a Database:**

  ```sql
  USE DATABASE database_name
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  USE DATABASE school
  ```

### Table Management Commands

- **Create a Table:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 type1, column2 type2, ...)
  ```

  Supported column types:
  - `INT` - Integer values
  - `STRING(n)` - Text of length n (default 255)
  - `FLOAT` - Floating point values
  - `BOOLEAN` - True/False values
  - `DATE` - Date values
  - `TIME` - Time values
  - `TIMESTAMP` - Combined date and time values
  - `BLOB(n)` - Binary data of size n (default 1024)

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name STRING(50), gpa FLOAT)
  ```

- **Use a Table:**

  ```sql
  USE TABLE table_name
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  USE TABLE students
  ```

- **Show Tables:**

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES
  ```

### Data Manipulation Commands

- **Insert Data:**

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...)
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, "Alice", 3.8)
  ```

  For string values, you can use either single or double quotes.

- **Select All Data:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM students
  ```

- **Select Data by ID:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = <id>
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 1
  ```

- **Update Data:**

  ```sql
  UPDATE table_name SET column = value WHERE id = <id>
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  UPDATE students SET name = "Alicia" WHERE id = 1
  ```

  ```sql
  UPDATE students SET gpa = 4.0 WHERE id = 1
  ```

- **Delete Data:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = <id>
  ```

  Example:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1
  ```

### Meta-Commands

- **Exit the Application:**

  ```
  .exit
  ```

- **View B-Tree Structure:**

  ```
  .btree
  ```

- **View Constants:**

  ```
  .constants
  ```
